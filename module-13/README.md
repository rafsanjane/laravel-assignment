# Part 2: Laravel Folder Structure

## Here is a brief description of the purpose of each folder in a Laravel project:

app: This folder contains the core files of the application, including models, controllers, and other PHP classes.

bootstrap: The bootstrap folder holds the files responsible for initializing the Laravel framework and loading necessary dependencies.

config: Inside the config folder, you can find the configuration files for the application, such as database settings, caching options, and logging configurations.

database: The database folder contains files related to database management, including migrations (schema changes), seeders (dummy data generation), and factories (data model factories for testing).

public: The public folder serves as the document root for the web server. It contains the front controller (index.php) and other publicly accessible assets like images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

resources: Inside the resources folder, you can find the views (templates) used by the application, language files for localization, and other resource files needed by the application.

routes: The routes folder contains the route definitions for the application. Here, you define how URLs are mapped to specific controller methods and actions.

storage: The storage folder is used to store temporary files, logs, and other files generated by the application during its operation.

tests: Inside the tests folder, you can find the test cases for your application. This is where you write automated tests to ensure the functionality and quality of your code.

vendor: The vendor folder contains the installed dependencies and packages managed by Composer, the PHP package manager.

.env: The .env file is a configuration file that holds environment-specific settings for the application, such as database connection details, API keys, and other sensitive information.
